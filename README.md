# Password-manager-cli
A simple and minimalistic command-line password manager written in python

This was originally meant as a small personal project, but I decided to create a Github page for it, in case anyone is interested in trying out the final result or giving feedback.

This command-line password manager aims to provide you with a simple but functional interface. 
It has the expected features like storing your credentials, and a few extras like a password generator and a password strength checker.
As of right now, it only works on windows. I might try to add support for more operating systems in the future

This is my first ever real python project, so expect to see some bugs and issues
If anyone has any suggestions for improvements, please tell me
